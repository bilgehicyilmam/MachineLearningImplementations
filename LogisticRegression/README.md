**LOGISTIC REGRESSION**

This is the implementation of binary logistic regression. When implementing the algorithm, I have created a dataset of size 
10.000 with four features and separated them as train and test data. The accuracy scores of Sklearn and the Python 
implementation are the same.

**OUTPUT**


```
Accuracy score of Python Implementation: 0.8936
Accuracy score of Sklearn: 0.8936
```
