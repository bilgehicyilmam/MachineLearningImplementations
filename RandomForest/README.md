# Random Forest

This is the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm that grows twenty decision trees as well as a decision tree algorithm using information gain as splitting criteria.  Since building the Random Forest model is computationally expensive, the number of trees is low.

The model has a 93% accuracy rate on the breast cancer dataset of Sklearn.
