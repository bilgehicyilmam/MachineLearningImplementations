# Principal Component Analysis

This is the implementation of Principal Component Analysis that takes the data in high-dimension and turns it into a lower dimension without losing valuable information. When implementing PCA, I have used the Iris dataset. The algorithm takes the four-dimensional data and turns it into a two-dimensional dataset.
