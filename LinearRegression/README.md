**SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION**

When implementing simple linear regression, I have created a dataset of size 100 and separated them as train and test data. I have used the methods of **ordinary least squares** and **gradient descent** along with Sklearn. 
It finds a linear relationship between the dependent variable (output y) and the independent variable (input x).

**OUTPUT**

**MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION**

When implementing multiple linear regression, I have created a dataset of size 1000 with four features and separated them as train and test data. I have used the methods of **ordinary least squares** and **gradient descent** along with Sklearn.
